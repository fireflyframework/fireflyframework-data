## Overview

Firefly Framework Starter Data is an opinionated starter that provides a production-ready architecture for building data-processing microservices. It combines job orchestration for batch and async data processing with a powerful data enrichment framework for third-party provider integration, all built on hexagonal architecture principles.

This starter is specifically designed for data-tier microservices that need to:
- Execute complex, orchestrated data processing workflows
- Integrate with external data providers (credit bureaus, financial data, business intelligence)
- Implement CQRS patterns for command/query separation
- Build event-driven architectures with automatic event publishing
- Support distributed transactions using SAGA patterns

The starter features abstract controller and service base classes that eliminate boilerplate, standardized RESTful endpoints, built-in job execution tracking, audit trails, resilience patterns (circuit breaker, retry, rate limiting), and comprehensive observability through metrics and distributed tracing.

## Features

- Job orchestration with async and sync execution modes
- Abstract data job controllers and services with standardized REST endpoints
- Data enrichment framework with pluggable `EnricherOperation` implementations
- Enrichment discovery controller for runtime operation catalog
- Smart enrichment controller with strategy-based data enrichment
- Job execution result persistence and audit trails
- CQRS auto-configuration for command/query integration
- EDA auto-configuration for event-driven data processing
- Transactional engine integration for saga-based data flows
- Resilience patterns with circuit breaker and retry decorators
- Observability with Micrometer metrics and distributed tracing
- Enrichment caching with configurable cache key generation
- Step event bridge for transactional engine coordination
- Persistence auto-configuration for job results and audit entries

## Requirements

- Java 21+
- Spring Boot 3.x
- Maven 3.9+
- PostgreSQL database (for job persistence)

## Installation

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.fireflyframework</groupId>
    <artifactId>fireflyframework-starter-data</artifactId>
    <version>26.02.04</version>
</dependency>
```

## Quick Start

```java
import org.fireflyframework.data.service.DataJobService;
import org.fireflyframework.data.controller.AbstractDataJobController;

@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api/data-jobs")
public class MyDataJobController extends AbstractDataJobController<MyRequest, MyResponse> {

    public MyDataJobController(DataJobService<MyRequest, MyResponse> service) {
        super(service);
    }
}

@Service
public class MyDataJobService extends AbstractResilientDataJobService<MyRequest, MyResponse> {

    @Override
    protected Mono<MyResponse> executeJob(MyRequest request) {
        return processData(request);
    }
}
```

## Configuration

```yaml
firefly:
  data:
    job-orchestration:
      enabled: true
      max-concurrent-jobs: 10
    enrichment:
      cache-enabled: true
      cache-ttl: 5m
    persistence:
      enabled: true
    observability:
      metrics-enabled: true
      tracing-enabled: true
```
