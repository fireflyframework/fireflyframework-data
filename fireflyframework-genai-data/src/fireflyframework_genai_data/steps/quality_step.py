"""Pipeline step that applies quality-gate validation rules to data."""

class QualityGateStep:
    """A :class:`StepExecutor`-compatible pipeline step that validates data.

    Each *rule* is a callable that receives the inputs dict and returns
    ``True`` when the data passes or ``False`` (or raises) when it does not.
    An optional human-readable description can be attached to each rule by
    passing ``(callable, description)`` tuples.

    If **any** rule fails the step raises :class:`ValueError` listing all
    violations so downstream steps are not executed with bad data.

    ----------

        Sequence of validation callables or ``(callable, description)``
        pairs.
